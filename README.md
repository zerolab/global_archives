Global Archives
===============

Global Archives is a Drupal simple, flexible, feature-rich solution for keeping track of historic events or items with location information.

Global Archives is a base Drupal installation profile for easy creation of [Timemap.js](http://code.google.com/p/timemap/) enabled projects.
The package consists of two drush make files that take care of all the project dependecies. It also makes use of the
